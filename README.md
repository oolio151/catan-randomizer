# catan-randomizer
Catan tile randomizer, so you dont mess stuff up doing it in real life

Simply select your options that you want in the dropdown and use it as a guide to build the tiles in real life. 

The canvas drawing logic was kinda vibecoded, because the only thing I could think of was to make a hex coordinate system to draw the tiles and that seemed like a lot of work for a quick project like this.

Currently Supported Modes:
<ul>
  <li>Base Catan</li>
  <li>Seafarers - Heading For New Shores</li>
